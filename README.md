# Tephra

A file manager that takes your obsidian tags to a whole new level

## Main Ideas

### 1. Clean UI

Really intuitive and modern UI

### 2. Tags

**Tags are the central component of the Tephra experience** - Tags can have subtags like subfolders these are seperated from their parents with a "/" - Tags should always be prefered over folders

### 3. Stack

- Egui

### 4. Philosophy

- Customizability
- Snappyness
- Extensibility
